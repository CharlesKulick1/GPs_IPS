# Data-Driven Gaussian Process Learning for Interacting Particle Systems

Read our papers here: [Single Kernel](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2106.02735) [Energy and Alignment Kernels](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2311.00902) [Multi-Species System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02053)

The code in this repository fully replicates the experiments showcased through our first two papers. This repository is currently under construction, and will soon be updated to include the multi-species framework. 

## Usage

Set example parameters at the top of [the main script file](MainScript.m). Running the file will carry out the entire learning pipeline, including visualization.

Fine control over all aspects of the data, from generation to learning, can be exercised through modifying [the Example files](Examples/) for each system.

To use our framework on new dynamics, add the appropriately defined files to the Examples folder. Our code is designed for easy extensionality.
